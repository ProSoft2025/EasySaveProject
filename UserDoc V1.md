## Start the application

Once you have installed our program, you will have multiple choices.

### Create a backup job

> To create a backup, you must have less than 5 backups.

* First, you need to choose whether your backup is a full or a differential. (A full backup will copy every files / folder while a differential one compares itself to a full and copy only modified files).
* To get started, you need to give your backup a name.
* Then you must add the path of your folder to save.
* Then put the path to your destination folder.
* For differential backup, you need to put the path to your folder where a full backup was made.

### Load a backup or other action with a backup

* To start a backup job, you must enter the name of the backup you want to do.
* After filling in the name of the backup, the execution will start. If the backup works fine, you will get a validation message.

### Log and state file

For any action on a backup a creation or update of the log and state file will be performed.
